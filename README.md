# SQLProject

A small one day project. The goals were to learn how to run sql on a .net platform (NPGsql in this case), and get familiar with Unity graphic buffers.

Things of note:
- Must be connected to Mines VPN for this to work. 
- Also you need the necessary role & user account to use it, so just logging in won't work.
- NEED a gpu, since this project is build on Unity URP + VFXgraph.
- Probably try to avoid scrolling in and moving too far with WASD, there are no bounds there.
- Running build is located at this link
- https://github.com/MehmetOzaslan/SQLProjectCrimeBuild/tree/main
- Not sure what the exact scale and corresponding map is, unfortunately DPD wasn't explicit about which coordinate system was used.
